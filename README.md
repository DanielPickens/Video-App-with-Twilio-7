My video communication application interface that makes rest api calls using the Twilio 7 api. Application is also using gatsby.js on frontend. 

Uses graphql query to automate api call as a constant placeholder image for relative path to return on the call reference to placeholder image in data as a parameter pass value. This gives the construct requests that pull data from multiple data sources in a single API call and adds flexibility to add or deprecate fields without impacting future existing queries.
