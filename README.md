My video communication application interface that makes rest api calls using the Twilio 7 api. Application is also using gatsby.js on frontend. 

Uses graphql query to automate api call as a constant placeholder image for relative path to return on the call reference to placeholder image in data as a parameter pass value. This gives the construct requests that pull data from multiple data sources in a single API call and adds flexibility to add or deprecate fields without impacting future existing queries.

# Contributions:
 Steps to contribute:
- Fork the project.
- Make your feature addition or bug fix.
- Add tests for it. This is important so that we don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
- Commit. Do not alter package.json, version, or history. (If you want to have your own version, that is fine, but bump version in a commit by itself that can be ignored when it gets pulled.)
- Submit a pull request.
